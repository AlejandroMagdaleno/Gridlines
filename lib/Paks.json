This concept is applied in the same manner to all number of players.\n\nThe Universal Offense Grid System is based on a numbering system. Each player is assigned a number. The field of play is then divided into a numbered grid. The quarterback can then instruct each player on where to go via numbers.\n\nAfter each play, the offense does not go into a huddle; they go directly back to their position on the offensive formation. This is especially useful when there is little time on the clock and the offense needs to score quickly.\n\nEach player lines up the same position each play unless the quarterback instructs differently. If a player is told to line-up in  different position; their original number assignment does not change.\n\nThe Universal Offense Grid System can be used in simple format or you can apply advanced techniques. If a defense begins to recognize the number sequence, you can change each players’ number and/or change the field grid numbers.",
